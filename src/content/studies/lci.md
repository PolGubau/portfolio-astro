description: During my academic year at LCI Barcelona in 2019-2020, I pursued a course in interdisciplinary design. This experience reinforced my passion for graphic design. Notably, I had the opportunity to apply my skills by leading the design and execution of both digital and physical campaigns for the VIDA festival, collaborating within a team of talented individuals.
