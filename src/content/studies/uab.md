description: I pursued my main degree in Interactive Communication at Autònoma de Barcelona from 2020 to 2024. This program allowed me to deepen my understanding of coding from a visual perspective and further develop my design skills. During my time at the university, I was honored with six scholarships in recognition of my academic achievements.
